    OVERVIEW: 
# ----------------------------------------
# ----------------------------------------

The project is the basic processing and analysis pipeline used to
conduct the NSF Cognitive Neuroscience project titled "Cognitive
Control Theoretic Mechanisms of Real-time fMRI-guided Neuromodulation
(Award# BCS-1735820). For award details, see:

    INTRODUCTION: 
# ----------------------------------------
# ----------------------------------------

The purpose of this code is to perform the following tasks:

1) Preprocess fMRI, psychophysiological, and cognitive-behaviorial
data for the project using best practices (and document literature of
each step).

2) Construct beta-series (Rissma, 2004) features for each data type
where relevant (fMRI,SCR,facial EMG,HRV, etc).

3) Predict cognitive (i.e., emotion) and physiological (i.e., SCR,
EMG, and HRV betas) via fMRI-derived whole-brain beta features to
identify the "plant" of the control system. For the purposes of this
project, we define the plant as the functional neuranatomical
activations encoding the valence and arousal dimensions of affect
according to the circumplex model of emotion.  Beta-series of fMRI are
referred to (pseudocorrectly) as brain states.  We are attempting to
predict as many cognitive and physiological measures as possible to
demonstrate the convergent validity of the brain state model of
emotion processing.

4) Conduct control theoretic analysis of how the brain manipulates
these quantities in two conditions.  The base condition, termed
Intrinsic Neuromodulation (IN), uses volition recall and
re-experiencing of affective images (drawn from the International
Affective Picture Set, see Lang et al., 2008)

5) Identify functional neuranatomical descriptions of affect
processing (including neural predictors of physiological signals), as
well as the neural drivers of affective control, currently defined as
the 1st and 2nd derivatives of the affective quantities (valence and
arousal).

    COMMITMENT TO OPEN SCIENCE
# ----------------------------------------
# ----------------------------------------

This project is commited to transparency and openscience
principles. Currently the project's codebase is largely written in
Matlab, csh,and AFNI (with a small set of functions writen in Python
2.7). A core goal of this project is to migrate the code base entirely
to a freely available language (~ Python 3).
